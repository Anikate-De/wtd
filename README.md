## 🤩 Inspired By

This project was inspired by Angela Yu's `Todoey` Flutter application, which was demonstrated in her course [The Complete 2021 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/) on Udemy.

This app deals with a crucial aspect that the `Todoey` app missed, which is, user data persistence. This app stores the data using the Flutter SharedPreferences package, thus making it available throughout every launch on the device.
